# ReactJS-final-project
In order to start this site, first open terminal, and cd into the client directory and run 'npm i'
Do the same in the server directory.
Also inside the server directory create a file called '.env' use the 'example.env' file in the root directory as a template
Add your connection url for your mongodb database and the port and mirror the port at client/src/api/index.js inside the url variable at the end of the path. If you do not add a port however it will default to port:5000 and will work just fine.
then run 'npm start' in each of these two directories, (the server and the client directories)

Everything I plan for this site is not yet functional, but all of the requirments in the assignment are being met at the moment.
That is, it connects to MongoDB, It uses CRUD operations, it uses nodeJS it uses ReactJS, and Redux. It is in fact a MERN application.
Once you open the site, and use the navigation to go to the 'servers' page. All of the necessary functionality (CRUD operations) on this page works.
